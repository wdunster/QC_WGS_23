## Extraction 12 -- Dec 1 
| Sample ID | Preserve  | 
|-----------|-----------|
| FL_4      | RNA later |
| FL_5      | RNA later |
| FL_6      | RNA later |

Changes to protocol: 
- Soaked all samples in molec water for 3 mins

Notes: 
- Incubate 8:30am - 1:00pm 
- Not all the tissue dissolved during the incubation period so I think that may be the cause of the low [DNA]

| Sample ID | Qbit og | Qbit clean |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| FL-2      | 5.79    | 0.316      |
| FL-4      | 19.5    | 3.75       |
| FL-5      | 11.85   | 2.47       |
| FL-6      | 3.58    | 0.475      |
| FL-12-B   | 0       | 0          |


## Extraction 11 -- Nov 30
| Sample ID | Preserve | 
|-----------|----------|
| FL_1      | DS       |
| FL_2      | DS       |
| FL_3      | DS       |

Changes to Protocol: 

Notes: 
- Incubating 8:30am - 1:30pm 
- These samples produced a super thick and gelatenous upper aqueous layer that I couldn't really pipette. Carlos suggested soaking the samples in molecular water before extracting DNA (these samples were stored in RNA later)

| Sample ID | Qbit og | 
|-----------|---------|
| FL_1      | 0       |
| FL_2      | 5.79    |


## Extraction 10 -- Nov 28
| Sample ID | Preserve | 
|-----------|----------|
| BVI_27_Ds | DS       |
| BVI_28_Ds | DS       |
| BVI_29_DM | DS       |
| BVI_30_DM | DS       |
| BVI_31_DM | DS       |
| BVI_32_DM | DS       |
| BVI_33_DM | DS       |
| BVI_34_DM | DS       |
| BVI_35_DM | DS       |
 
Changes to Protocol: 
- incubate at 56C for 15 hours 
- 2x2 cm tissue -- I think this is still too much though because after the 15 hrs I still have large segments of tissue in the tubes

Notes: 
- I had more then 750 uL of liquid to load into the minicolumn which was good
- It seems the original [DNA] is high however most of it is filtered out

| Sample ID | Qbit og | Qbit clean | 
|-----------|---------|------------|
| BVI_27_DS | 18.85   | 2.23       |
| BVI_28_DS |         | 25.5       |

| BVI10_B   |         | 0          |


## Extraction 9 -- Nov 20 
Quantifying old samples Diana extracted years ago

Notes: 
- [DNA] was very high in almost all samples of the subset I did (22 samples). I diluted in 20uL of tris to increase vol before cleanup 
- Cleaned 15uL DNA

Changes to protocol: 
- 30 uL PK
- Incubate 58C and 600 rpm for 5 hrs (10:00am - 3:00pm)
- Eluted in 100 uL total (x2 50uL elutions)

Notes: 
- I did not have time to clean up today. I will clean up and quantify tomorrow
- I accidentlly swapped BVI-21 DS and BVI-22 DS so I had to get rid of both samples. Hopefully the DMSO version has amplified adequately. 
- The extraction definetly takes much longer with more samples

Changes to protocol:

- Incubate 58C and 600 rpm for 5 hrs (9:30am - 2:30pm)
- Eluted in 50 uL and then 25 uL instead of x2 50 uL elutions
- In the clean up eluted in 20 uL instead of 25 uL

| BVI_16_DS | 26.4  |
| BVI_17_DS | 14.15 |
| BVI7_B    | 0     |


Notes: 
- Overall this extraction went much better then previous extractions with most samples having a high (>30 ng/uL concentration). 2 main changes were made in the elution volumes as well as incubating for 1 extra hour (5 hrs)
- After digestion 15-DM, 14-DS, and 17-DS had larger clumps of visible tissue left in the tube, however they were significantly smaller then the original pieces so I continued with the extraction

Notes: 
- There are no results for this extraction. I forgot to add ethanol before adding the HBC buffer so I had to terminate the extraction. I have reorganized my reagents to prevent this in the future



## Extraction 3 -- Oct 19

- added 30 uL Proteinase K
- incubate in the thermomixer for 4 hrs at 59C and 600 rpm
- 1 vol = 250 uL
- x2 50 uL elution buffer elutions

Notes: 
- incubation 9am to 1pm
- At 12:30 the tissue was well broken down in all tubes. Previously after the incubation period the tissue has still been well intact. I vortexed all tubes quickly to make sure all tissue was broken up. The only tube left with a small piece of tissue was BVI_8_DMSO
- 50 uL into the clean and concetrate cleanup
- Added 30 uL elution buffer for clean up elution

Oct 16

Notes: 
- Incubation start 5:35 pm
- I remembered to do both ML1 and Proteinase K this time 
- Note that DS samples with PK immediately turned white and milky upon vortexing, but cleared once placed in the thermomixer

Steps;
1. Preheated Thermomixer to 56C 
2. UV'd 10 microcentrifuge tubes, 8 scalpel, 3 forceps, and pipette tips 
3. Labeled 8 tubes with sample ID and 3 tubes with sample ID and molecular water
4. Thawed samples on ice
5. Filled one 1.5 mL tube for every DMSO sample with 1 mL of molecular water
6. Using forceps I removed BVI_1_DM  stored in DMSO, cut a 2ish cm piece with a scalpel, and placed it in the corresponding molec water tube. Soaked scalpel in a 70% Bleach solution
7. Rinsed forceps with molecular water
8. Using the rinsed forceps I removed BVI_1_DS  stored in DNA Shield, cut a 2ish cm piece with a new scalpel, and placed it in the corresponding 1.5 mL tube. Soaked scalpel in 70% bleach
9. Rinsed forceps in molec water 
10. Using the rinsed forceps, I moved the BVI_1_DM sample soaking in molec water to a new 1.5 mL tube
11. Placed the tube on ice and forceps in 70% bleach bath (with scalpels)
12. Added 350uL of ML1 and 25 uL of Proteinase K to each tube
13. Started incubation in thermomixer (Oct 16 5:35pm - Oct 17 7:30am)


Oct 17
- Samples off thermomixer at 8:23
- 200 uL vol
- 500 uL sample into the minicolumn
- 2x elution with 50 uL elution buffer
- Transferred 50uL of DNA to new tubes for the clean up
-50 uL elution buffer

What I did:
1. Preheated Thermomixer to 56C 
2. UV'd 10 microcentrifuge tubes, 8 scalpel, 3 forceps, and pipette tips 
3. Labeled tubes with sample ID
4. Took out samples and put on ice
5. Filled one 1.5 mL tube for every DMSO sample with 1 mL of molecular water

7. Rinsed forceps with molecular water
8. Using the rinsed forceps I removed BVI_1_DS  stored in DNA Shield, cut a 2ish cm piece with a new scalpel, and placed it in the corresponding 1.5 mL tube. Soaked scalpel in 70% bleach
9. Rinsed forceps in molec water 
10. Using the rinsed forceps, I moved the BVI_1_DM sample soaking in molec water to a new 1.5 mL tube
11. Placed the tube on ice and forceps in 70% bleach bath (with scalpels)
12. Repeated steps 6-11 for the remaining samples. 
13. Started digestion following [EZNA_Mollusc_DNA_Protocol](https://github.com/wdunster/QC_WGS_23/blob/main/EZNA_Mollusc_DNA_Protocol.md)
14. Rinsed all soaking scalpels and forceps twice with alternating 70% Ethanol and DI. UV'd all equipment for 15 mins

Notes: 
- Started bath at 8:13pm 
- Need to thaw DS samples for 10-15 mins


Oct 15 -- 10:30 am 

Note I forgot to add proetinase K last night. I added at 10:30 and will incubate at 60C for 30 mins 

Notes: 
- 300 uL BL
- Everything has to happen in the fume hood 
- Prep hazardous waste disposal for all tips, liquids, and gloves
- Only 750 uL sample inserted to minicolumns 
- Dried minicolumns at 15,000g for 2 min
- 75 uL Elution buffer (double check personal protocol to see if i have a step to heat it)
- Modify reagent aliquot to include a second elution step 
- I decided not to do the additional clean up because I forgot the PK in the digestion step. I want to see if this worked to begin with.
