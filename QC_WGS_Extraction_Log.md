Notes: 
- There are no results for this extraction. I forgot to add ethanol before adding the HBC buffer so I had to terminate the extraction. I have reorganized my reagents to prevent this in the future



## Extraction 3 -- Oct 19
| Sample ID | Preserve   | 
|-----------|------------|
| BVI_7_DM  | DMSO       |
| BVI__DM   | DMSO       |

Changes to protocol: 
- Reduced size of tissue sample to about 1x1 cm 
- added 30 uL Proteinase K
- incubate in the thermomixer for 4 hrs at 59C and 600 rpm
- 1 vol = 250 uL
- x2 50 uL elution buffer elutions

Notes: 
- incubation 9am to 1pm
- At 12:30 the tissue was well broken down in all tubes. Previously after the incubation period the tissue has still been well intact. I vortexed all tubes quickly to make sure all tissue was broken up. The only tube left with a small piece of tissue was BVI_8_DMSO
- 50 uL into the clean and concetrate cleanup
- Added 30 uL elution buffer for clean up elution

Oct 16

Notes: 
- Incubation start 5:35 pm
- I remembered to do both ML1 and Proteinase K this time 
- Note that DS samples with PK immediately turned white and milky upon vortexing, but cleared once placed in the thermomixer

Steps;
1. Preheated Thermomixer to 56C 
2. UV'd 10 microcentrifuge tubes, 8 scalpel, 3 forceps, and pipette tips 
3. Labeled 8 tubes with sample ID and 3 tubes with sample ID and molecular water
4. Thawed samples on ice
5. Filled one 1.5 mL tube for every DMSO sample with 1 mL of molecular water
6. Using forceps I removed BVI_1_DM  stored in DMSO, cut a 2ish cm piece with a scalpel, and placed it in the corresponding molec water tube. Soaked scalpel in a 70% Bleach solution
7. Rinsed forceps with molecular water
8. Using the rinsed forceps I removed BVI_1_DS  stored in DNA Shield, cut a 2ish cm piece with a new scalpel, and placed it in the corresponding 1.5 mL tube. Soaked scalpel in 70% bleach
9. Rinsed forceps in molec water 
10. Using the rinsed forceps, I moved the BVI_1_DM sample soaking in molec water to a new 1.5 mL tube
11. Placed the tube on ice and forceps in 70% bleach bath (with scalpels)
12. Added 350uL of ML1 and 25 uL of Proteinase K to each tube
13. Started incubation in thermomixer (Oct 16 5:35pm - Oct 17 7:30am)


Oct 17
- Samples off thermomixer at 8:23
- 200 uL vol
- 500 uL sample into the minicolumn
- 2x elution with 50 uL elution buffer
- Transferred 50uL of DNA to new tubes for the clean up
-50 uL elution buffer


## Extraction 1 -- Oct 14 & 15

Oct 14 -- 7:15pm 

| Sample ID | Preserve   | 
|-----------|------------|
| BVI_1_DM  | DMSO       |
| BVI_2_DM  | DMSO       |
| BVI_3_DM  | DMSO       |
| BVI_1_DS  | DNA Shield |
| BVI_2_DS  | DNA Shield |
| BVI_3_DS  | DNA Shield |
| BVI1_B    | Blank      | 

What I did:
1. Preheated Thermomixer to 56C 
2. UV'd 10 microcentrifuge tubes, 8 scalpel, 3 forceps, and pipette tips 
3. Labeled tubes with sample ID
4. Took out samples and put on ice
5. Filled one 1.5 mL tube for every DMSO sample with 1 mL of molecular water
6. Using forceps I removed BVI_1_DM  stored in DMSO, cut a 2ish cm piece with a scalpel, and placed it in the corresponding molec water tube. Soaked scalpel in a 70% Bleach solution
7. Rinsed forceps with molecular water
8. Using the rinsed forceps I removed BVI_1_DS  stored in DNA Shield, cut a 2ish cm piece with a new scalpel, and placed it in the corresponding 1.5 mL tube. Soaked scalpel in 70% bleach
9. Rinsed forceps in molec water 
10. Using the rinsed forceps, I moved the BVI_1_DM sample soaking in molec water to a new 1.5 mL tube
11. Placed the tube on ice and forceps in 70% bleach bath (with scalpels)
12. Repeated steps 6-11 for the remaining samples. 
13. Started digestion following [EZNA_Mollusc_DNA_Protocol](https://github.com/wdunster/QC_WGS_23/blob/main/EZNA_Mollusc_DNA_Protocol.md)
14. Rinsed all soaking scalpels and forceps twice with alternating 70% Ethanol and DI. UV'd all equipment for 15 mins

Notes: 
- Started bath at 8:13pm 
- Need to thaw DS samples for 10-15 mins


Oct 15 -- 10:30 am 

Note I forgot to add proetinase K last night. I added at 10:30 and will incubate at 60C for 30 mins 

Notes: 
- 300 uL BL
- Everything has to happen in the fume hood 
- Prep hazardous waste disposal for all tips, liquids, and gloves
- Only 750 uL sample inserted to minicolumns 
- Dried minicolumns at 15,000g for 2 min
- 75 uL Elution buffer (double check personal protocol to see if i have a step to heat it)
- Modify reagent aliquot to include a second elution step 
- I decided not to do the additional clean up because I forgot the PK in the digestion step. I want to see if this worked to begin with.
