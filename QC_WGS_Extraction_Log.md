## Extraction 1 - Oct 14 & 15

Oct 14 -- 7:15pm 

| Sample ID | Preserve   | 
|-----------|------------|
| BVI_1_DM  | DMSO       |
| BVI_2_DM  | DMSO       |
| BVI_3_DM  | DMSO       |
| BVI_1_DS  | DNA Shield |
| BVI_2_DS  | DNA Shield |
| BVI_3_DS  | DNA Shield |
| Blank     | DNA Shield | 

What I did:
1. Preheated Thermomixer to 56C 
2. UV'd 10 microcentrifuge tubes, 8 scalpel, 3 forceps, and pipette tips 
3. Labeled tubes with sample ID
4. Took out samples and put on ice
5. Filled one 1.5 mL tube for every DMSO sample with 1 mL of molecular water
6. Using forceps I removed BVI_1_DM  stored in DMSO, cut a 2ish cm piece with a scalpel, and placed it in the corresponding molec water tube. Soaked scalpel in a 70% Bleach solution
7. Rinsed forceps with molecular water
8. Using the rinsed forceps I removed BVI_1_DS  stored in DNA Shield, cut a 2ish cm piece with a new scalpel, and placed it in the corresponding 1.5 mL tube. Soaked scalpel in 70% bleach
9. Rinsed forceps in molec water 
10. Using the rinsed forceps, I moved the BVI_1_DM sample soaking in molec water to a new 1.5 mL tube
11. Placed the tube on ice and forceps in 70% bleach bath (with scalpels)
12. Repeated steps 6-11 for the remaining samples. 
13. Started digestion following [EZNA_Mollusc_DNA_Protocol](https://github.com/wdunster/QC_WGS_23/blob/main/EZNA_Mollusc_DNA_Protocol.md)
14. Rinsed all soaking scalpels and forceps twice with alternating 70% Ethanol and DI. UV'd all equipment for 15 mins

Notes: 
- Started bath at 8:13pm 
- Need to thaw DS samples for 10-15 mins
